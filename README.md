# csharpgame
I made this game as an exercise for learning C#

This game is a simple 'Roguelike' RPG where you kill monsters, collect gold, and buy better gear. The game is turn-based, each movement from the player is one turn.

To play the game, navigate to csharpgame/bin/Windows/x86/Debug within the repo and run csharpgame.exe.
The game requires .NET Framework.
